#  For this project, I did data analysis on students' academics performance. I especially was curious if their parents' background education has to do with their test scores. Also, I created a linear model that predicts students' writing scores using math and reading score. Hope y'all like it!

#2. Preparation 
  a. libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(caTools)
library(plotly)

   b. Upload data
per <- read_csv("StudentsPerformance.csv")

   c. Data Structure
str(per)

3. Data cleaning/EDA

4. In-dept EDA about parents educational background
# I made a new datafame of parents each latest education to find a trend. The df includes sum of lunch (standard & reduced), test prep (completed & incomplete), and average of all test scores.

#As we can see parents education does not have any pattern when it comes to lunch or test prep. My initial hypothesis was that parents with high educational background tend to understand the significance for preparations. Despite the sample size for bachelor and master degree is small, it is safe to conclude that education level has nothing to do with their childrenâ€™s preparation.
